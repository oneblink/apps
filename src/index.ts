 * ### Service Worker
 *
 * To display push notifications and allow them to be clicked to open the
 * application, add the following JavaScript to your service worker (we
 * recommend using [offline-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/offline-plugin)):
 *
 * #### Example
 *
 * ```js
 * self.addEventListener('push', (event) => {
 *   console.log('push event', event)
 *
 *   if (!event.data) {
 *     console.log('Received push event without any data', event)
 *     return
 *   }
 *   const notification = event.data.json()
 *
 *   event.waitUntil(
 *     clients.matchAll().then((c) => {
 *       if (c.length === 0 || c.every((client) => !client.focused)) {
 *         // Show notification
 *         return self.registration.showNotification(
 *           notification.title,
 *           notification.options,
 *         )
 *       } else {
 *         console.log('Application is already open!')
 *       }
 *     }),
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * self.addEventListener('notificationclick', (event) => {
 *   console.log('notification click event', event)
 *
 *   const pathname =
 *     event.notification.data && event.notification.data.pathname
 *       ? event.notification.data.pathname
 *       : '/'
 *
 *   event.waitUntil(
 *     clients.matchAll().then((clis) => {
 *       const client = clis[0]
 *       if (client === undefined) {
 *         // there are no visible windows. Open one.
 *         clients.openWindow(pathname)
 *       } else {
 *         client.navigate(pathname)
 *         client.focus()
 *       }
 *
 *       return self.registration
 *         .getNotifications()
 *         .then((notifications) => {
 *           notifications.forEach((notification) => {
 *             notification.close()
